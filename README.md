# Test Challenge

Test Suite on [Basic Calculator](https://testsheepnz.github.io/BasicCalculator.html).

Test Cases for the four basic operations (Addition, Substraction, Multiplication, Division) were created following these criteria:

1. Partitioning between negative numbers, zero, and positive numbers (Integers)
2. Considering some ends on each partition with numbers: -10, -1, 0, 1 and 100
3. Adding other cases considering real numbers
4. Three posible combinations:
   a. First Number > Second Number
   b. First Number = Second Number
   c. First Number < Second Number

The resulting Test Data can be reviewed on [TestCases.xlsx](TestCases.xlsx)
